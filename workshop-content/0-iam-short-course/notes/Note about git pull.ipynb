    "When you open a Jupyter notebook and make changes to it, sometimes `git` will give you a hard time when you then try and `pull` the repository to get the latest updates. The simplest option is to overwrite all of the changes you made to the file. You can do this using \n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git pull -f origin master\n",
    "```\n",
    "However, if you want to keep your local changes, then you have to do something with them before you can `pull` from the `remote`. The way to do this is as follows\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git stash\n",
    "git pull \n",
    "git stash pop\n",
    "```\n",
    "Now, if there is a conflict when you try to pop the stash back on top the new commit, you can resolve it in the following way:\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "git checkout --theirs -- myfile.txt\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "I think this [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10414769/git-pull-keeping-local-changes) answer probably does a better job describing the specific situation, while this [documentation page](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-checkout) gives in-depth detail on `git checkout`. "
